# Creating Your Own Image
If you want to create your own image, you can customize it following the steps below.

## Environment Preparation
You need an X86 PC, preferably running Ubuntu LTS version, such as Ubuntu 24.04.

## Installing Dependencies
Image creation requires qemu installation. Please install our recommended version by referring to the [qemu installation guide](https://bianbu.spacemit.com/system_integration/bianbu_3.0_rootfs_create/#qemu).

## Image Creation
You can run the following command to create all three images simultaneously:
```bash
sudo ./debian-image-create.sh
```
You can also specify parameters:

- Minimal
```bash
sudo ./debian-image-create.sh minimal
```

- GNOME
```bash
sudo ./debian-image-create.sh desktop
```

- XFCE
```bash
sudo ./debian-image-create.sh xfce
```
